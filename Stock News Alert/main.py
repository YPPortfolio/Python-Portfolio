## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price.

STOCK = "XOM"
COMPANY_NAME = "Exxon Mobil"
CLOSE_TIME = "16:00:00"
CLOSE_KEY = "4. close"

STOCK_API_KEY = "API KEY"

    "function": "TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY",
    "symbol": STOCK,

    "outputsize": "compact",

yesterday_closing_price = float(stock_data[SERIES][YESTERDAY +" " + CLOSE_TIME][CLOSE_KEY])
price_change = round((today_closing_price-yesterday_closing_price)/yesterday_closing_price * 100, 2)

if price_change >= 3 or price_change <= -3:
    news_list = get_news()
    if price_change >= 3:
        symbol = "UP"
    if price_change <= -3:
        symbol = "DOWN"
    send_email_notification()




## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator



## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.



#Optional: Format the SMS message like this: 
"""
